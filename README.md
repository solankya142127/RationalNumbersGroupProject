adding the two numbers together (40/16)

subtraction: As with addition, creating a common multiple, and converting the second number to a negative (-28/16)
to subtract the two numbers (-16/16)

multiplication: A simple operation of multiplying the numerators and denominators (3*7/4*4 = 21/16)

division: a multiplication operation, by inverting the second number (3/4 * 4/7 = 12/28)
